    internal and external.Let's see how it goes.
    </h3>
    <div>In electronics, a decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to decouple (i.e. prevent electrical energy from transferring
    to) one part of a circuit from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor,
    reducing its effect on the rest of the circuit. For higher frequencies, an alternative name is bypass capacitor as it is
    used to bypass the power supply or other high-impedance component of a circuit.
